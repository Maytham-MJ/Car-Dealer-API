# Car-Dealer-API

This project is of two parts: 

1. Frontend
2. Backend

#Backend ‚å®Ô∏è

I have built a Restful Web API for a Car Dealership using Java, Spring Boot, Java Bean, MySQL, IntelliJ, and Postman.
The API allows the dealership to have full control over its car inventory by providing the ability to create, update, and delete cars. Additionally, it allows customers to use the dealership's services to post their cars for sale. 


#Frontend üñ•Ô∏è

On the front, I have built it using React, Vanilla CSS, and JavaScript
