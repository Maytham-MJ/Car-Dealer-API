## Car Dealership Restful Web API Documentation

### Overview
The Car Dealership Restful Web API is designed to provide a comprehensive solution for managing a car dealership's inventory. It is built using Java, Spring Boot, Java Bean, and MySQL. The API allows the dealership to have full control over its car inventory by offering functionalities to create, update, and delete cars. Additionally, it enables customers to use the dealership's services to post their cars for sale.

### Technologies Used
The Car Dealership Restful Web API is developed using the following technologies:

#### Backend:
- Java: The programming language used to build the backend logic of the API.
- Spring Boot: A powerful framework for building robust and scalable Java applications.
- Java Bean: A class used to represent the data structure of a car entity.
- MySQL: The relational database management system used to store car inventory data.

### Features
The Car Dealership Restful Web API offers the following features:

#### Backend:
- Create Car: Dealership staff can add new car details to the inventory using the API endpoint.
- Update Car: Existing car information can be modified or updated through dedicated API routes.
- Delete Car: Cars that are no longer part of the inventory can be removed using the API.

### Project Structure
The project's file structure is organized as follows:

#### Backend:
- `src`: The source directory containing the Java code for the API.
  - `controllers`: Contains the API controllers responsible for handling HTTP requests and responses.
  - `models`: Includes the Java Bean class representing the car entity.
  - `repositories`: Holds the classes responsible for database operations using Spring Data JPA.
  - `services`: Contains the service classes that implement the business logic.
- `resources`: Contains the application.properties file for configuring the MySQL database.
- `pom.xml`: The Project Object Model (POM) file that contains the project's dependencies and settings.

### Getting Started
To run the Car Dealership Restful Web API on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Set up a MySQL database and update the database configuration in `application.properties`.

3. Run the Spring Boot application using your preferred Java IDE or Maven command:
   ```
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

4. The API will be accessible at the specified localhost address (e.g., http://localhost:8080).

### Testing with Postman
To interact with the API endpoints, use Postman or any API testing tool:

1. Open Postman and create a new request.

2. Set the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) based on the desired action.

3. Enter the API endpoint URL (e.g., http://localhost:8080/api/cars).

4. Add any required request parameters or payload for the specific endpoint.

5. Send the request and observe the response.
